      This paper provides an empirical investigation of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence through the lens of binary classification using machine learning algorithms and deep learning. We first establish the theoretical foundations of KL divergence and its role in machine learning. Through a series of experiments with three different classification models, we visualize and analyze how the KL divergence evolves during the training process and influences the behavior of the model.
